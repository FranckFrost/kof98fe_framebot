## Introduction
This is a KOF 98FE bot in a very early stage of development made by [@Franck_Frost](https://twitter.com/FranckFrost), and based on the XV bot by [@Lantors](https://github.com/dens0ne) to which a lot of credit goes to. The  information is pulled from the current latest [Framedata sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/100XfeqQCZB7uaeg9DJ3yWIIu6lHLbhdhs7B8b8eWRpY) for /frames and directly from the [Dream Cancel wiki](https://dreamcancel.com/wiki/The_King_of_Fighters_%2798_UMFE) for /cargo.

## Usage
The bot has a `/frames` and a `/cargo` slash command that both accept 2 arguments:
- the `character` which is a case insensitive string (e.g. Kyo, Iori)
- the `move` which is a case insensitive string of the motion or name (e.g. Crouch C, dp+A, 236+C)

## Notes
Hitbox images will be added slowly, starting with normal moves.
